# Script to filter comments out of a Windows .bat file and then run
# the remaining text as commands. This makes it easier to share simple
# scripts between operating systems.

# Usage:
#
# If run without arguments, this runs the script of the same name as
# this but with a .bat extension.
#
# If run with an argument, processes the first argument as a script.
