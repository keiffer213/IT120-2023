# Animal Shelter Sample Database

This is a sample database that models an animal shelter,
with a number of link tables and many-to-many relationships
that offer opportunities to work with JOINs.

## What is included

- "shelter.pdf" which describes the scenario in more detail and provides suggests on writing JOINs
- a Diagrams.net ERD for the database (SVG in PDF)
- SQL to create and populate the database
- a "reset.bat" file that scripts dropping, recreating, and populating the sample
- a "reset.sh" script that runs "reset.bat", to support development with Unix-like shells (macOS, Linux, git-bash)
- "TRACKING.md": a framework for tracking work
- suggested queries that could be implemented

Some potential queries:

- Client needs
- Series Schedule
- Vaccination History
- Booster Timing
- Available Homes
- Booster Vaccination Schedule

## What to do

- read the PDF
- set up the database with the reset.bat (or reset.sh) script
- review TRACKING.md and sign up to write a query
- work on queries that interest you (in queries.sql, if you want)
- update TRACKING.md with your experience (short is OK!)
